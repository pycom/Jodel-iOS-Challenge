## Pycom iOS Challenge

Pycom Challenge is an app for showing [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com) pictures in a Collection View.
We've setup some boilerplate code for you ðŸ™‡ Your assignment is to improve the app and make it an enjoyable picture browsing experience.
We'll give you some tips, but the requirements and specification are quite open.

Please fork this repository and commit your code to it. Document/decribe your solution in SOLUTION.md file.
Send us link with your solution repository.

Remember, our goal is not to *compare* and *grade* the projects, but to get to know you better. We care about the quality, not quantity, we don't want you to waste your precious time.

### Architecture

â€¢Â We would like you to use the MVVM architecture or an iteration of MVVM. Try to solve the problem of mixing business and presentation logic in the View Model

â€¢Â The project should be very easy to unit test. The project should have at least one unit test

â€¢Â The current boilerplate code is in Objective-C. The networking layer should stay in Objective-C and the rest of the app should be in Swift

â€¢ Feel free to choose the Observer mechanism (RxSwift, ReactiveCocoa, your own creation)

â€¢Â Support error scenarios by simply showing an alert view

â€¢Â Feel free to use any third-party libraries

### Requirements

â€¢Â The feed should be vertical, one picture per row

â€¢Â The app should cache the images so they're available when the app is offline

â€¢Â User should be able to tap the pictures in the feed to preview them in fullscreen

â€¢Â The app should show loading indicators when the feed is loading

â€¢ Document your solution in SOLUTION.MD file

**Good luck**!
